# A Game of Preys and Hunters
All the assignments of the Programming Style SoSe 2020 class consist in re-implementing the same program over and over, using a different style every time. This follows the same approach proposed by C. Lopes in her book *"Exercises in Programming Style."*

The program we will implement is a non-interactive, non-competitive game called "Preys and Hunters" which is modeled after the kids board game from Ravensburger [*"Tempo, kleine Fische!"*](https://www.ravensburger.de/23334/product.html), which is also known as *"Avanti, Mare!"* 

A short description of the game is available at the [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24658/avanti-mare) while the official rules as defined by Ravensburger can be found [here](https://www.ravensburger.de/spielanleitungen/ecm/Spielanleitungen/229617_23334%2072dpi.pdf)
